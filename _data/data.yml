    summary: |
      Hi there! Thanks for checking out my resume. Let me tell you a little
      bit about myself. I am a fast learner, curious student and excellent 
      communicator with experience providing exceptional 
      customer service in a variety of channels. Whether face to face or
      online, I have mastered the abilty to connect with customers and
      build lasting, meaningful relationships.
      
      Meeting people where they are with patience, friendliness, 
      and humor is my approach in making customers feel comfortable 
      and open to learning new things. Ultimately, this creates
      a strong base of product advocates who are excited about your product
      and will spread the good word! And that's what we're all after, right?
      
      I am looking for the perfect opportunity to utilize the skills that
      I have acquired, but also the perfect opportunity to learn, grow and
      build new skills to keep myself evolving and reaching my goals. Let me
      help you to reach your own customer experience goals by contributing my
      easy going personality, love of connecting with others, and desire to
      learn something new everyday to your business.
