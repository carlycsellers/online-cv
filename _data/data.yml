        I had an opportunity to embark upon an extended leave of travel, which I
        decided to embrace (as I hope most of us would!). This opportunity allowed

        that I never knew existed for myself. I hope this time is viewed as an asset,
        as I feel I am now a more effective, aware, and reenergized person who is
        ready and able to contribute and learn in any new endeavor.

        Beyond serving our customers, I took on the role of administrator for our
